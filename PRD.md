### **1. Introduction & Problem Statement**

#### **1.1. Problem Statement**

In today's competitive job market, a significant majority of companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes before they are ever seen by a human recruiter. Millions of highly qualified candidates are automatically rejected because their resumes are not formatted for these systems. Job seekers, especially those in creative or non-technical fields, often use visually appealing templates with columns, graphics, and custom fonts that are unreadable by ATS bots. This results in frustration, missed opportunities, and the incorrect assumption that their skills are not in demand.

#### **1.2. Product Vision**

**ClarityCV** is a user-friendly web application that empowers job seekers to instantly transform any resume from a PDF or Word document into a clean, professional, and perfectly formatted ATS-friendly version. By handling all processing directly in the browser, ClarityCV offers an immediate, secure, and completely private solution.

### **4. Features & User Stories**

#### **4.1. MVP Features**

The entire application will run client-side in the user's browser. No data is ever sent to a server.

* **US-1 (File Upload):** As a user, I want to upload my resume in `.pdf` or `.docx` format from my local device, so that the application can process it.
* **US-2 (Client-Side Parsing):** As a user, I want the app to instantly parse my resume within my browser, stripping away incompatible formatting and identifying standard sections.
* **US-3 (Review & Edit):** As a user, I want to see the converted text in a simple, in-app editor, so that I can correct any parsing errors or make small tweaks before downloading.
* **US-4 (Download):** As a user, I want to download my converted resume directly to my computer in both `.docx` and `.txt` formats.

#### **4.2. Future Features (Post-MVP)**

These features may be added in future free versions of the tool.

* **Job Description Analysis:** Allow a user to paste a job description to see a client-side comparison of keyword overlap.
* **Multiple Templates:** Offer a selection of different ATS-friendly templates that can be applied to the parsed text.

### **5. User Journey (Flow)**

The user journey is simplified to be entirely anonymous and instantaneous.

1.  **Landing Page:** User arrives and sees a clear call-to-action: "Upload Your Resume." A strong privacy statement ("Your data never leaves your browser") is prominently displayed.
2.  **Upload:** User drags-and-drops or selects their resume file. The file is loaded directly into the browser's memory.
3.  **Processing:** The application's JavaScript code parses the file instantly on the client's machine. A loading indicator is shown briefly.
4.  **Editor View:** The user is taken to a simple editor view showing the converted, single-column text.
5.  **Edit & Refine:** User makes any necessary corrections.
6.  **Download:** User clicks a "Download" button and chooses their preferred format (`.docx` or `.txt`), triggering a direct browser download. The session is complete.

***

### **6. Functional Requirements**

* **Client-Side Processing:** All application logic, including file reading, parsing, and document generation, **must** occur client-side using JavaScript. **No resume data or PII shall be transmitted to any server.**
* **Supported Upload Formats:** The app shall accept `.pdf` and `.docx` files.
* **Parsing Logic:** The script must remove images, tables, text boxes, columns, and special fonts, converting the content to a standard web font.
* **Editor Functionality:** The editor must support basic text functions: bold, italics, underline, and bullet points.
* **Download Functionality:** The app must generate and trigger downloads for `.docx` and `.txt` files from the browser.

### **7. Core Principles for High-Quality ATS Conversion**

This section outlines the foundational best practices that will guide the development of ClarityCV's parsing and conversion engine. These principles are derived from extensive research into how modern Applicant Tracking Systems operate.

#### **7.1. Structural & Formatting Rules (The "Must-Haves")**

* **1. Enforce a Single-Column Layout:**
    * **Why:** ATS parsers read from left to right, top to bottom. Multi-column layouts can cause the system to read information out of order. Our engine must linearize all text into a single, logical column.
* **2. Remove All Graphics and Visual Elements:**
    * **Why:** All images, logos, photos, charts, and graphical elements are either ignored or can cause significant parsing errors.
* **3. Standardize Fonts:**
    * **Why:** Custom or decorative fonts are often not recognized. The engine will standardize all text to a universal font like **Arial**, **Calibri**, or **Georgia**.
* **4. Eliminate Headers & Footers:**
    * **Why:** Many ATS versions ignore content in headers and footers. Critical contact information must be moved into the main body of the document.
* **5. Convert Tables to Standard Text:**
    * **Why:** Tables are a common point of failure. The engine must extract text from table cells and format it in a linear sequence.
* **6. Use Simple, Standard Bullet Points:**
    * **Why:** Fancy symbols can be misinterpreted. The engine should convert all list items to use standard solid round or square bullet points.

#### **7.2. Content & Keyword Rules (The "Intelligence")**

* **1. Standardize Section Headings:**
    * **Why:** The ATS looks for specific keywords to understand structure. The engine should attempt to identify and rename sections to standard conventions (e.g., "My Professional Journey" â†’ "**Work Experience**").
* **2. Ensure File Type Compatibility:**
    * **Why:** By providing both **`.docx`** and **`.txt`** as download options, we give the user maximum flexibility for any application system.
* **3. Promote Keyword Best Practices:**
    * **Why:** The ATS is a search engine. By creating a clean, editable text version, we make it easy for users to manually add relevant keywords from a job description.

***

### **8. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** End-to-end conversion and display on an average modern computer should feel instantaneous (under 3 seconds).
* **Privacy & Security:** The application will not use cookies for tracking and will not send any user-generated data to a server. This must be a core, stated feature.
* **Usability:** The UI must be clean, intuitive, and fully responsive for both mobile and desktop use.
* **Reliability:** The statically-hosted site must have extremely high availability, typical of platforms like Netlify.

***

### **9. Success Metrics (KPIs)**

As the tool is anonymous, all metrics will be event-based and non-identifying.

* **Total Conversions:** The number of times a resume is successfully parsed.
* **Download Rate:** The percentage of conversions that result in a file download.
* **Session Duration:** Average time a user spends in the app.
* **File Type Usage:** A simple count of `.pdf` vs `.docx` uploads.

***

### **10. Monetization Strategy**

The ClarityCV MVP will be **completely free to use**. It will serve as a portfolio piece, a tool to build a positive brand reputation, and a way to validate the core parsing technology before considering any future product expansions.

***

### **11. Proposed Technology Stack**

The stack is designed to be extremely lightweight, modern, and completely frontend-based.

* **Framework:** **Next.js (Static Export)**
    * **Why:** We will use Next.js for its excellent developer experience. The final product will be a **Static Site Export** (`next export`), creating a pure Single Page Application (SPA) that can be hosted on any static hosting service.
* **UI/Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** with **Shadcn UI**
    * **Why:** This combination allows for rapid development of a custom, modern, and stylish UI that is also highly performant and accessible.
* **Client-Side Document Parsing Libraries:**
    * **For PDF (`.pdf`):** **`pdf-parse`** - A JavaScript library that can be bundled and run directly in the browser.
    * **For Word (`.docx`):** **`mammoth.js`** - Designed to run in both Node.js and the browser, making it perfect for our client-side conversion needs.
* **Deployment & Hosting:** **Netlify (Free Tier)**
    * **Why:** Netlify is a world-class platform for deploying static sites. Its free tier provides a global CDN, automatic SSL, and a seamless `git`-based workflow.
